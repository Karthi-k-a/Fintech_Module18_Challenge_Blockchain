### Overview
This challenge aims at building a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface for one of the five largest banks in the world. This ledger will allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

### Steps
The following steps were performed in [pychain.py](https://github.com/Karthi-k-a/Fintech_Module18_Challenge_Blockchain/blob/main/pychain.py) file to achieve the results-<br>
- Create a new data class named Record. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.
- Modify the existing Block data class to store Record data.
- Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit interface.
- Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records.

### Results
The complete PyChain ledger and user interface was tested by running the Streamlit application and storing some mined blocks in the PyChain ledger. Then the blockchain validation process was tested by using the PyChain ledger as per below screenshots.<br>
